				While car crashes remain a leading cause of death, roads are getting safer.
				Over the last half-century, the number of automobile fatalities per vehicle mile
				traveled in the United States decreased 80 percent, from 5.3 deaths per 100 million
				vehicle mile traveled in 1965 to 1.07 today.
			</p>
			<p>
				Policy changes have played a large role in reducing the number of fatalities. Until
				the 1960s, for instance, there were no U.S. seat belt laws. Today, 49 of the 50 states
				require passengers to wear seat belts. Explore below how average fatalities differ
				depending on statesâ€™ policies.
